            Hey. Hi. I like reading. I love re-reading. Currenty reading, liking and loving  A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson. I enjoy making things. Things like... my bed, songs, groovy dance moves, lasagne, chicken soup, vegetable soup, chicken vegetable soup, soup soup and SOUP SOUP. I also like and love coding. I like it when I'm missing one of these elusive ')' fellas for more than 5 minutes but I LOVE it when my console log says "It works... IT WORKSSSS!!!! WE HAVE DATA!!".
            <br/> <br/> 
            <strong>Coding is great. I can make things that make things that make things! </strong>
